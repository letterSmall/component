The main goal of ergonomics is to increase the productivity of the system by providing the user with a completely comfortable and supportive environment.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Life is full of ergonomics, we just take it for granted. Ergonomics simply means that product design that conforms to the physiological structure of the human body can be said to be ergonomic. Your shoes are ergonomically designed to fit right and left. But if you wear the right shoe on your left foot, it is uncomfortable no matter how you wear it, and this design does not conform to the structure of the human foot, which is against the ergonomic design.<\/p>","width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left","text_size":"medium","text_color":"black","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style":"sf__btn-primary","button_size":"","block_custom_class":""}},"164930257544f28f65-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ergonomic-sit.png","link":"","width":"50%","alignment":"center","block_custom_class":""}}},"block_order":["164930257544f28f65-0","164930257544f28f65-1"],"settings":{"heading":"<h1>What is an Ergonomic Chair?<\/h1>","subheading":"","description":"3 minutes to fully understand what is ergonomics","header_alignment":"center","container":"container","background_color":"","gap":30,"use_scroll_mobile":false,"gap_mobile":16,"custom_class":""}},"16493025809e274a42":{"type":"image-with-text","settings":{"heading":"","subheading":"","container":"container-fluid","background_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","item_gap":100,"item_gap_mobile":30,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/what-is-ergonomic-stand.png","link":"","layout":"left","image_column_size":"6","hover_effect":false,"title":"","sub_title":"","text":"<p>The ergonomic chair is another result of this research, which has been used to help users focus more on their work by improving posture and reducing back and neck pain, which can lead to other ailments.

Ergonomic chairs can also help freelancers be more productive while working from home.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In fact, the ergonomics of a chair is much more complicated than the simple structure of a shoe, not only to consider the human limbs, cervical spine, spine, head, but also to consider the coordination of ergonomics. For example, in terms of back ergonomics, not only the headrest and the backrest are ergonomic, but more importantly, the headrest and the backrest are combined, and the position of the headrest relative to the backrest cannot be too high, too low, too forward or backward.
